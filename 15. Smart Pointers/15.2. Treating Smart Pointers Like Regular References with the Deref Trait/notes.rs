// Notes
// 1. Implementing the Deref trait allows customization of the behavior of the dereference operator (*).
// 2. Regular references can be followed to access the value they point to using the dereference operator.
// 3. Box<T> can be used like a reference, and the dereference operator works the same way on Box<T> as on regular references.
// 4. The author defines a custom smart pointer type called MyBox<T> and encounters an error when trying to use the dereference operator on it.
// 5. The Deref trait is implemented for MyBox<T> to enable dereferencing with the * operator.
// 6. Deref coercion is a feature that automatically converts references to types implementing Deref trait into references to the types they point to.
// 7. Deref coercion allows functions and methods to accept different types of references without explicitly adding references or dereferences.
// 8. Deref coercion can be used with custom smart pointer types like MyBox<T> to automatically convert them to the types they contain when passed as function arguments.
